## 🧭 **Architecture Draft (based on real IGEMS workflow)**

### 1️⃣ Operator Workflow

1. Operator **scans barcode** from IGEMS report → the web app receives a Job ID.
2. App calls backend:
   `GET /api/jobs/WJ-20251101-SS30`
3. Backend loads:

   * `metadata.json` (parsed from IGEMS report)
   * `.nc` file (for simulation)
4. Frontend shows:

   * **Simulation** (XY toolpath animation)
   * **Client, Material, Thickness**
   * **Approx. Cut Time**
   * **Machine Parameters (Pressure, Orifice, Nozzle, etc.)**

---

## 🧠 **Next Step: What We’ll Do for the AI Prompt**

When you tell me to proceed, I’ll craft the **AI prompt for the Minimax Agent** that:

1. Reviews all code modules (`parser.js`, `simulation.js`, `timeEstimator.js`, `api.js`).
2. Checks logic for:

   * NC parsing (detecting pierces, feedrate, segment length)
   * Unit consistency (mm/min, mm/s)
   * Formula correctness
   * Rendering precision in simulation
3. Suggests optimizations (e.g., arc interpolation, caching, async parsing)
4. Verifies JSON schema against IGEMS report fields.

The prompt will be ready for direct input into Minimax to act as your **code QA engineer**.

---

## 🧩 **Open Questions Before Finalizing Prompt**

1. Do you want me to make the barcode system **auto-detect Job IDs** (e.g., regex from PDF text), or will you store Job IDs manually in a JSON database?
2. Should the Minimax agent focus **only on reviewing existing code**, or should it **suggest and refactor logic automatically**?
3. Do you plan to use **Node.js + React**, or do you prefer a **Python Flask + WebGL frontend** stack for the web app?

---

Once you answer those, I’ll write your **Minimax Agent Prompt** (ready-to-feed) with:

* role, objectives, and evaluation criteria
* test dataset (from this IGEMS sample)
* review and refactor directives

Would you like me to sketch how the backend should extract fields (like material, thickness, speeds) from `.docx` or `.pdf` next — or shall I move straight to drafting the Minimax AI prompt?

Excellent starting point — before we automate or integrate the barcode system, let’s understand **how IGEMS uses barcodes**, **how they’re embedded in reports**, and **how we can hook into them** for your project.

Here’s a full breakdown 👇

---

## 🧾 **1️⃣ What IGEMS Barcodes Are**

In IGEMS (the CAD/CAM suite for waterjet cutting), **barcodes are metadata identifiers** embedded into job reports, setup sheets, or printed NC program summaries.

They’re typically **Code 39**, **Code 128**, or **QR** symbols that encode a **unique job reference**, which corresponds to:

* a **CNC file**,
* a **drawing/project**, or
* a **nest ID (sheet layout)**.

This barcode lets operators or production managers quickly identify and pull up the digital job data.

---

## 🎯 **2️⃣ Purpose of Barcodes in IGEMS Workflow**

| Use Case                    | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Job Identification**      | Each barcode uniquely identifies a job or sheet. Operators scan it to open the matching NC file or production data instantly.                    |
| **Automation**              | Used in smart factories or MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems) — scanning triggers machine setup scripts or production tracking.               |
| **Traceability**            | Links physical parts/sheets to their corresponding cutting files, material batches, or customers.                                                |
| **Paper-to-Digital Bridge** | When operators receive printed IGEMS reports on the shop floor, scanning the barcode loads the corresponding job on their tablet or workstation. |
| **Error Reduction**         | Avoids manual job selection errors (especially when dozens of NC files exist for different sheets).                                              |

---

## 🧩 **3️⃣ Where IGEMS Adds Barcodes**

IGEMS lets you add barcodes via the **Report Template Editor**:

* In `Reports → Job Report Template → Edit Template`.
* You can insert a **Barcode Field** (linked to variables like `JobName`, `FileName`, or `SheetName`).

Typical placements:

* Top-right corner of job report.
* Next to sheet info or file list.

### 🧠 Example:

A barcode could represent:

```
JobID: WJ20251101-SS30
File: /nc/WJ20251101-SS30.nc
```

Encoded as text:
`WJ20251101-SS30`

When scanned, the operator’s tablet app receives this Job ID and fetches all related info.

---

## ⚙️ **4️⃣ How IGEMS Generates or Customizes Barcodes**

In the **Report Designer**:

1. You can insert a barcode object (similar to adding a text field).
2. Choose:

   * **Barcode type:** Code 39, Code 128, QR, etc.
   * **Source field:** `JobName`, `SheetName`, or custom variable.
3. Optionally concatenate fields:

   ```
   =JobName & "-" & Material & "-" & Thickness
   → WJ20251101-SS30
   ```
4. The output can be configured to also include:

   * File path to NC file
   * Project name
   * Customer name

---

## 🔗 **5️⃣ How It Works with External Systems**

Once barcodes are on the reports, you can integrate them with:

* **Shop-floor tablets** running a web or Android app (like the one you’re planning).
* **MES / ERP systems** (e.g., JobBOSS, Odoo, ECI, or custom systems).
* **Label printers** (to tag cut parts for post-processing).

When scanned, the app or system uses the **barcode as a key** to fetch:

* NC file (for simulation),
* job metadata (from database or IGEMS report),
* client/material info,
* and estimated cut time.

---

## 💡 **6️⃣ Example Workflow (Applied to Your Project)**

### 🔹 **In IGEMS**

You configure your report template to include:

```
Barcode = [JobName] or [SheetName]
```

### 🔹 **On the Shop Floor**

1. Operator opens the printed report.
2. Scans barcode with tablet camera.
3. Your web app decodes barcode → e.g., `SHEET-3670`.
4. App calls backend API:

   ```
   GET /api/jobs/SHEET-3670
   ```
5. Backend returns:

   * IGEMS metadata (parsed from DOCX)
   * NC file path
   * Client info, material, thickness, etc.
6. App renders simulation and estimated time.

---

## 🧠 **7️⃣ Why This Matters for Your System**

✅ **Bridges IGEMS and your Web App** seamlessly.
✅ **No manual input** for operators.
✅ **Extremely scalable** — one barcode per report.
✅ **Compatible with Android tablets** via web camera scanning.
✅ **Perfect for database indexing** — barcode = unique key.

## 🧩 **8️⃣ Next Steps to Integrate Barcodes**

| Step | Task                                                                 | Tool                             |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1    | Verify how IGEMS currently encodes the barcode (text only or URL)    | Open template in Report Designer |
| 2    | Decide your job key convention (e.g., “SHEET-####” or custom format) | Define schema                    |
| 3    | Create small Node.js/Express backend with endpoint `/api/jobs/:id`   | Backend service                  |
| 4    | Use `QuaggaJS` or `ZXing` on frontend for camera scanning            | Frontend                         |
| 5    | Link barcode scan → fetch job data → show simulation                 | App integration                  |

Would you like me to show you **how to configure IGEMS to insert barcodes** (step-by-step inside the report template), or do you want to first see **how your web app should interpret scanned barcodes** (API + JS example)?

Perfect — this screenshot is from the **IGEMS Report Template Editor**, specifically the *Barcode Field Properties* dialog. You’ve opened the settings for adding a **QR Code** into your job report. Let’s go through what’s happening here and how you can use it effectively for your workflow.

---

## 🧩 **Understanding This Window**

### 🔹 **Barcode Type**

* You’ve selected **QRCode**, which is ideal for your case.
* QR codes can hold more text (URLs, JSON, job IDs, etc.) than Code128 or Code39.
* This makes them better for use with mobile/tablet scanners.

---

### 🔹 **Text / Datasource Field**

* The key setting here is the **Datasource → Field** dropdown (on the right of your screenshot).
* It allows you to pick *which IGEMS variable* will be encoded into the QR code.

From your image, you can see options like:

```
ID, Name, Template, Drawing, Material, Machine, Job, SheetReport, etc.
```

Each of these categories expands to **subfields**, e.g.:

* `Job.CNCFile`
* `Job.Name`
* `Material.Name`
* `SheetReport.SheetName`
* `Machine.Name`
* etc.

---

## 🧠 **How to Use It for Your Integration**

You can make this barcode encode **any combination** of fields — that’s what your web app will later read.

### ✅ **Option 1 — Encode a Single Identifier**

Simplest and cleanest:

* Field: `SheetReport.SheetName`
  → e.g. `SHEET-3670`

Then your tablet app scans the QR → sends request:

```
GET /api/jobs/SHEET-3670
```

---

### ✅ **Option 2 — Encode Multiple Fields (recommended for automation)**

You can also **concatenate** fields to embed richer info (job name, material, thickness, etc.) in one QR.

Example (set “Text” to):

```
=Job.Name & "|" & Material.Name & "|" & Material.Thickness & "|" & SheetReport.SheetName
```

This QR will encode something like:

```
SMB Eng 30mm SS|Stainless Steel|30|SHEET-3670
```

Your Android app can then decode and parse it easily into:

```json
{
  "job": "SMB Eng 30mm SS",
  "material": "Stainless Steel",
  "thickness": 30,
  "sheet": "SHEET-3670"
}
```

---

### ✅ **Option 3 — Encode a URL (for direct linking)**

If you want your tablet app to **open directly to the job**, encode a URL.

Example:

```
=https://yourserver.com/job?id= & SheetReport.SheetName
```

→ QR code becomes:

```
https://yourserver.com/job?id=SHEET-3670
```

Then when the operator scans it, the browser automatically opens that page showing the simulation and job data.

| **Show Text**          | Off (optional)                 | Keeps report clean                   |                         |                         |
| **Datasource Field**   | Use Expression                 | Build custom text                    |                         |                         |
| **Expression Example** | `=SheetReport.SheetName & "    | " & Material.Name & "                | " & Material.Thickness` | Simple parseable format |
| **Placement**          | Top-right corner of job report | Standard convention                  |                         |                         |

---

## 🧭 **End-to-End Workflow with This Setup**

1. IGEMS generates report with QR:
   `SHEET-3670|Stainless Steel|30`
2. Operator scans QR → web app receives string.
3. Web app parses data:

   ```js
   const [sheetId, material, thickness] = qrString.split('|');
   ```
4. Fetch job metadata + NC file:

   ```
   GET /api/jobs/SHEET-3670
   ```
5. Display:

   * Client
   * Material
   * Thickness
   * Simulation
   * Calculated cut time

---

## ⚙️ **Next Steps (Recommended Order)**

1. ✅ Confirm you want to use **QR codes with custom text** (Option 2).
2. I’ll show you the **exact IGEMS expression syntax** to insert it into the template.
3. Then, I’ll help you build a **JavaScript decoder** for your web app that interprets the QR string into job data.

---

Would you like me to now give you the **exact IGEMS report formula expression** (copy-paste ready) for your QR code that includes *SheetName, Material Name, and Thickness* in pipe-delimited format?
